## Welcome.

- Hello, my goal is to store scripts and programs that I build or I can fork to help me learn programming. 
- I want to learn more and better python, bash, PowerShell, java, c#, and whatever other language is useful at the time. 
- My main focus is InfoSec and cyber security. I hope to one day make a living as an ethical hacker. 
- If you find anything useful here, feel free to send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mikensec) and feel free to send me any constructive criticism and ways to improve my code. I'm always open to learning new things.
